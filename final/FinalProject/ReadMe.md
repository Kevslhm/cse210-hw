#Function Solver

This program helps people to solve Linear functions Like: Proporcional Functions, General Functions, Constanst Functions, and Cuadratic Functions.
The Function Solver will print in the console the respective Value Table of each of the functions that the user select to solve.

This program consist of the following classes:
-LinearFunctions this one is the base abstract class
-ProportionalityFunctions this class is a derived class of LinearFunctions
-GeneralFunction is a derived class also inherit the base class LinearFunctions
-ConstantFunction also a derived class
-CuadraticFunction a derived class of LinearFunctions

There are some behaviors that where declered as abstract like the following:
-ValueTable this one is void
-SetFunctio this one is void as well
-GetFunctionData this one is string method.
